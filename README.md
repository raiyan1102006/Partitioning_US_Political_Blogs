# Partitioning a network of US political blogs
This is a study on network partitioning using the Spectral Modularity Maximization algorithm. In this problem I have studied a network of Internet blogs on the subject of US politics, with the goal of partitioning the graph into liberal (i.e., Democrat) and conservative (i.e., Republican) ‘blogger communities’.
